multi_traffic
===============

python module for ganglia 3.1.

This module is based on hirose31's traffic1 DSO module. Thanks for his work.

multi_traffic send metrics of transmitted and received network traffic on multiple 
network devices. And Web_front could show these metrics seperately, Unlike ganglia's 
net_module show all traffic metrics together. 

## example

See conf.d/multi_traffic.conf, to send traffic on eth0 and eth1.
